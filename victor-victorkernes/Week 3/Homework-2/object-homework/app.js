// 1. Suppose that we wanted to create a browser-based calendar program for keeping track of things. In comments, list at least three reasonable abstractions that you might use to build this program; for each abstraction, list out at least two properties and behaviors that it would make sense for that abstraction to have. Below is an example - please write your answer in the same format.
  // 'car'
  // description: our app manages car sales.
  // every 'car' has
  // - a make
  // - a model
  // - a year
  // every 'car' can
  // - drive
  // - brake
  // - park

// Answer Starts Here

//'calendar'
// description: our app allows you to keep track of things.
// every 'calendar' has
// - a day
// - a week
// - a month
// every 'calendar' can
// keep track of tasks
// add new tasks
// allow you to see daily, weekly, or monthly overviews of tasks

// Answer Ends Here


// 2. Create an Object literal that lines up with the following description. Store it in the variable 'pet_owner', below. Be sure to give it reasonable values for each of its properties.

  // 'Owner'
  // Description: We are making an app for a veterinary clinic - it manages pets' vaccinations.
  // Every 'owner' has:
  // - a name
  // - an address

// Answer Starts Here
pet_owner = {
  name: 'Bob',
  address: '225 Bush St, San Francisco, CA 94104'
};

pet_owner = {
  name: 'Bruce',
  address: '555 Powell St, San Francisco, CA 94105'
};

// Answer Ends Here


// 3. Create an Object literal that lines up with the following description. Store it in the variable `some_pet`, below.

  // Pet
  // Description: We are making an app for a veterinary clinic - it manages pets' vaccinations.
  // Every 'pet' has:
  // - a name
  // - a species
  // - a breed
  // - a noise that it can make (e.g. 'bark', 'meow', etc.)
  // Every pet can:
  // - make noise (each pet makes its own unique noise, as specified by `noise`.

let some_pet;

// Answer Starts Here
some_pet = {
  name: 'Mint',
  species: 'cat',
  breed: 'persian',
  noise: 'meow',
  makeNoise: function() {
    console.log(some_pet.noise);
  }
};

some_dog = {
  name: 'Casper',
  species: 'dog',
  breed: 'Pitbull',
  noise: 'woof',
  makeNoise: function() {
    console.log(some_pet.noise);
  }
};
